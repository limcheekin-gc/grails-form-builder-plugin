A sister project, the [JQuery Form Builder plugin](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-form-builder-plugin/) implements client-side of this project using JQuery, JQuery UI and other `JavaScript` libraries, it is server-side technology independent, you can implement the back-end of the Form Builder using any language, framework and platform you preferred.
